# Feature Planning Guidelines

When planning new features, follow these principles:

## Architecture First

- Consider how the feature fits into existing architecture
- Identify dependencies and affected components
- Plan for backwards compatibility
- Consider scalability and performance implications

## Design Patterns

- Use established design patterns from the codebase
- Maintain consistency with existing code structure
- Follow SOLID principles
- Plan for testability from the start

## Breaking Down Work

- Decompose features into manageable units
- Identify critical path vs. nice-to-have elements
- Plan incremental delivery when possible
- Consider feature flags for gradual rollout

## Risk Assessment

- Identify technical risks and mitigation strategies
- Consider security implications
- Plan for error handling and edge cases
- Document assumptions and constraints

## Documentation Planning

- Plan what documentation will be needed
- Consider API documentation requirements
- Plan for user-facing documentation
- Identify training or onboarding needs
