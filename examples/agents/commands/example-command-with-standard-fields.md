# Example Command

This command demonstrates the new standard frontmatter fields:
- `id`: A unique identifier for the command
- `name`: A human-readable name
- `description`: A description of what the command does

These fields are metadata only and do not affect command matching.
Commands are still referenced using slash syntax like `/example-command-with-standard-fields`.
