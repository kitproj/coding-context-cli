# Proof of Concept Guidelines

These guidelines apply when creating proof of concepts or prototypes.

## Focus on Speed and Learning

- **Prioritize speed over perfection**
- Use the simplest approach that demonstrates the concept
- Hardcode values where it speeds up development
- Skip comprehensive error handling
- Don't worry about edge cases initially

## What to Skip

- **DO NOT** write tests
- **DO NOT** add detailed comments
- **DO NOT** follow production code standards
- **DO NOT** optimize for performance
- **DO NOT** handle all error cases
- **DO NOT** worry about backwards compatibility

## What to Include

- **DO** make it functional enough to validate the approach
- **DO** document key findings and learnings
- **DO** note what would need to change for production
- **DO** identify blockers or challenges
- **DO** keep code simple and readable

## Documentation

Instead of code comments, focus on:
- High-level approach explanation
- Key findings and discoveries
- Performance characteristics observed
- Identified risks or challenges
- Next steps for production implementation
- List of assumptions made

## Goal

The goal is to answer questions like:
- Is this approach technically feasible?
- What are the main challenges?
- What's the approximate effort for production?
- Are there better alternatives?
- What are the performance characteristics?
