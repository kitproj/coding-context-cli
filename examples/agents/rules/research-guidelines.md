# Research Guidelines

These guidelines apply when conducting technical research.

## Research Approach

- **Be thorough and comprehensive**
- Investigate multiple approaches
- Review existing implementations
- Consult authoritative sources
- Consider trade-offs objectively

## What to Research

- Current state of the art
- Existing implementations and libraries
- Performance characteristics
- Security implications
- Compatibility and integration concerns
- Community adoption and support
- Licensing considerations
- Long-term maintenance implications

## Documentation Requirements

Your research should produce:

1. **Executive Summary**
   - Key findings in 2-3 paragraphs
   - Clear recommendation
   - Primary risks

2. **Detailed Analysis**
   - Comparison of different approaches
   - Pros and cons of each option
   - Performance benchmarks if available
   - Security considerations
   - Cost implications

3. **Supporting Evidence**
   - Links to documentation
   - Code examples demonstrating concepts
   - Benchmark results
   - Case studies
   - Community feedback

4. **Recommendations**
   - Preferred approach with justification
   - Alternative options ranked
   - Implementation considerations
   - Risk mitigation strategies
   - Timeline estimates

## What to Avoid

- **DO NOT** implement production-ready code
- **DO NOT** write comprehensive tests
- **DO NOT** spend time on polishing code examples
- **DO** include minimal code snippets to illustrate points
- **DO** focus on understanding and documentation

## Output Format

Present findings in a clear, well-structured document:
- Use markdown for formatting
- Include diagrams where helpful
- Provide working code examples
- Link to external resources
- Summarize clearly
