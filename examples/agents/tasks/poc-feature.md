# Proof of Concept - Feature Exploration

You are tasked with creating a quick proof of concept to validate a technical approach.

## Issue Information

- **Feature**: ${feature_name}
- **Goal**: ${poc_goal}

## Your Task

1. **Quick Implementation**
   - Focus on demonstrating the core concept
   - Use the fastest approach that works
   - Hardcode values where appropriate
   - Skip error handling for non-critical paths

2. **Validate Approach**
   - Prove the technical feasibility
   - Identify potential blockers
   - Document findings and learnings

3. **Document Results**
   - Show what works and what doesn't
   - Note performance characteristics
   - List next steps for production implementation

## Guidelines for POCs

- **DO NOT** write tests - focus on speed
- **DO NOT** add detailed comments - code is temporary
- **DO NOT** follow production code standards - this is exploratory
- **DO** use shortcuts and temporary solutions
- **DO** document your findings
- **DO** note what would need to change for production

## Output

Provide:
- Working proof of concept code
- Summary of findings
- Recommendation on approach
- List of production requirements if this moves forward
