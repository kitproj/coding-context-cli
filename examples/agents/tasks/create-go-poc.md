## Requirements

- **Feature**: ${feature_name}
- **Goal**: ${poc_goal}

## Your Task

1. **Prototype the Concept**
   - Create minimal working code to demonstrate the idea
   - Focus on functionality over code quality
   - Use quick and dirty solutions where appropriate

2. **Demonstrate Viability**
   - Show that the concept works
   - Identify potential issues early
   - Document key learnings

## Guidelines

- Speed over perfection - this is a throwaway POC
- Skip comprehensive tests for now
- Skip detailed comments - code clarity is enough
- Document only the key insights and learnings
